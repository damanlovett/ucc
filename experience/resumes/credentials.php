          <p>Students, particularly at the graduate level, may

            manage and send electronic and print files.  Interfolio allows users to include content
            beyond a resume, transcript and letters of recommendation (e.g. writing
            samples, dissertation summaries, student evaluations.) Interfolio may also be used for applications
            to graduate and professional schools. </p>

             <ul>
                <li> <strong>Authorization to release</strong> – Due to Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
                  of 1974 (FERPA), no file will be sent by the UCC without the signed <a href="../../pdfs/ref_release.pdf">authorization
                to release form</a>. </li>
                <li> <strong>Resume</strong> – View <a href="sampleresumes.php">sample resumes</a>. </li>
                <li> <strong>Recommendations</strong> – The UCC provides reference forms for your references to complete (see below) – or they may prefer to use their own letterhead.  Teacher candidates: most school systems require you to use their own forms.  If you use the UCC forms, complete the top section first.  Provide a stamped envelope addressed to the UCC for their convenience.  Instruct them to seal the recommendation in an envelope with their signature over the seal.  You are not permitted to view the contents of the letter. </li>
                <li> <strong>Transcript (optional)</strong> - A transcript can be included, but is not required.  Request an official transcript
                  through <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/registrar/faq/transcript.html">Registration &amp; Records</a> and have it sent to the UCC for
                inclusion in your file.  </li>
             </ul>
           <hr />
             <p>* Incomplete files -- it is your responsibility to check periodically to see if your file is complete with release form, resume, recommendations, and transcripts (optional). No requests will be honored until your file is complete. If your file is not complete within 6 months of the initial opening date, the file may be purged. If the file is purged, you must begin the entire process again in order to re-open the file. </p>

              <p>Consider these options as you choose your best references.  Allow at least a couple of weeks for a
              reference to complete the form and return it to the UCC.  Once in a while they may need a gentle
              reminder.  Ask them to save a hard or electronic
              copy; it is possible for a letter to get lost. </p>
