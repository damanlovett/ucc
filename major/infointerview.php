          <p>&quot;Good morning, this is Meredith Jones.  I'm a sophomore in the English Department at
            NC State.  I met you at a career fair in
            February, where I learned about your arts publications.  I have become very interested in this field
            and have a few questions.  Would you be
            available to meet with me on a Thursday or Friday afternoon?  I would like to conduct an informational
            interview so that I can learn more about this field.  I would be pleased to come to your
            office."    </p>
          <p><strong>STEP 3:&nbsp; <i>conduct an interview</i></strong><br>
Be professional. Arrive 5-10 minutes early, dress in             <a

            and bring your enthusiasm!</p>

              did you know what you wanted to do? </li>
