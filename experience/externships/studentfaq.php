        <p><strong>Who can participate and when does the externship occur?</strong><br>
          The externship program is currently offered to NC State College of Engineering freshmen and sophomores. The externship will take place during spring semester; dates will be            determined and announced during fall semester.</p>
        <p>          <strong>How long do externships last?</strong><br>
          The externship will be between 1-2 business days depending on your employer's preference.</p>
        <p>          <strong>Can I earn academic credit for the externship?</strong><br>
          No. Externships are not eligible for academic credit.</p>
        <p>          <strong>What is the difference between an externship and an internship?</strong><br>
          Externships are short term (between 1-2 business days), and offer no pay or academic credit.          Internships are longer term and can take place  year round and are paid in most fields. Externships are excellent opportunities for students to be considered for future internships -- several past externs have been offered internships the following summer!</p>
        <p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Outstanding academic record (3.0+ GPA), resume and statement explaining your interest in the program. </li>
          <li>Freshman and sophomore College of Engineering student. </li>

          <li>Refundable payment of $100. to the UCC. Will be refunded after completion of the program.          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>          <strong>What are the travel arrangements and costs for externships?</strong><br>
          Externships are either within 3 hours driving distance from NC State or may be available in locations          near your permanent address. <strong><em>You are responsible for your own travel arrangements and costs to travel to your          externship location</em>.</strong> This includes transportation, meals and lodging. Externship host(s) may          treat you to lunch or assist you with other traveling expenses, but do not expect this.</p>
        <p>          <strong>How do I apply for externships?</strong></p>
