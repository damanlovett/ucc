        <p><strong>Mission</strong><br>
The mission of the University  Career Center (UCC) at NCState University is to provide career  planning, career development, and job search assistance for students of the  university seeking career opportunities.   The UCC is the official campus liaison between students, employers and  academic departments, and provides assistance and resources to serve all  constituencies.  </p>
        <p><strong>History</strong><br>
          The UCC began  as the Career Planning &amp; Placement Center in 1965 as a result of the  Chancellor&rsquo;s request to School Deans to combine &ldquo;placement services&rdquo; into one  centralized office.  The name was changed  to the University Career Center in 1993 to better reflect the mission of  preparing students for the world of work.  Satellite offices have been established in  some colleges to provide specialized career services.  The UCC collaborates with these offices,  while serving all students in all majors.     </p>
